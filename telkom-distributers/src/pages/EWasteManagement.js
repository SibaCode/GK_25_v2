//Sample SMS to customer

//“SERVICE ALERT: Unusual activity detected on + 27821234567. We’ve requested your bank(s) to pause high - risk actions.If this is you, reply YES within 2 mins to cancel the pause, else call + 27 - XX - XXXX - XXXX.”

//(Keep messages short; prefer push / app confirmation where possible.)

//Insurance / coverage model suggestions

//Premium model: low monthly fee or small annual premium; underwriting uses phone age, number usage profile, geographic risk.

//    Coverage: reimburse verified financial loss due to approved SIM swap fraud up to policy limits; optionally provide credit monitoring / identity restoration services.

//        Exclusions: customer negligence(sharing PIN / OTP), failure to enable recommended protections, or delays caused by third - party institutions beyond SLA.

//Claims flow: claim intake ? require telco event logs + bank transaction logs ? forensic review ? payout within X business days if claim valid.

//    Legal & compliance considerations

//Must obtain explicit, informed consent from the subscriber to share telco events with third parties(banks / insurers).Keep consent records auditable.

//Comply with local data protection laws(e.g., POPIA in South Africa) — minimise stored PII, encrypt data at rest & in transit, implement access controls.

//    Agreements / MOUs with MNOs and banks to accept signed machine - to - machine notifications and to act on them.This may require regulatory engagement.

//Clarify liability: if platform notifies but the bank fails to act, liability may rest with the bank or be apportioned in contract.Define SLAs and mutual indemnities.

//Regulatory sandbox may help accelerate pilot with telcos and banks.

//    Business / partnership strategy

//Pilot with one telco + 1–2 banks: prove the ingestion of SIM events, partner acknowledgement flows, and mitigation effectiveness.

//Insurance underwriter partnership: partner with an insurer to underwrite losses while you provide the tech & orchestration.Alternatively, self - insured with reinsurance.

//Telco integration: negotiate access to real - time SIM lifecycle events(IMSI change, port requests, subscriber notifications) — most critical piece.

//Bank integrations: start with API / webhook agreements to accept alerts and apply pre - agreed protective actions.

//Fraud detection signals(sources of truth)

//IMSI change / new IMSI for a MSISDN

//SIM activation events on same MSISDN with different SIM IDs

//Port - out request events(number portability)

//Recent password reset / OTP attempt patterns across linked services

//IMEI change + location mismatch

//Multiple failed authentication attempts

//Metrics & SLA to track

//Time from telco event ? partner alert sent(target < 10s)

//Partner acknowledgement time(target < 30s)

//False positive rate(target < 5 %)

//Successful prevented fraud attempts(tracked via near misses)

//Claim approval time & payout accuracy

//Sample SLAs for partners

//Telco: deliver event webhooks within 5s of event; sign messages with agreed key.

//    Bank: acknowledge alerts within 30s; apply temporary protective actions within 2 minutes for high - risk alerts(or confirm manual escalation).

//        Platform: deliver signed alert and store non - repudiable audit within 10s; 99.9 % uptime.

//            Challenges & mitigations

//Telco cooperation: negotiation heavy.Solution: pilot with one MNO and prove ROI(reduction in fraud payouts) to attract others.

//Bank action variability: different banks have different onboarding / automations — produce standard API spec and SDKs.

//False positives annoying customers: provide easy override(one - tap confirmation) and adaptive scoring to reduce friction.

//Legal liability: get strong contractual protections & clear consent.Consider regulator engagement early.

//    Pricing & go - to - market ideas

//Freemium: basic alerting for free; premium paid tiers include insurance coverage, faster response, and family plans.

//    B2B2C: sell service bundled through telcos as value - add and offered to their customers; share revenue with telco and bank partners.

//        Enterprise: sell to banks / insurers as a whitelabeled product for their customers.

//Next steps(practical, actionable)

//Draft a short one - page technical spec and partner API doc(use the sample above as a base).

//Approach a friendly telco partner with a pilot ask: provide access to SIM lifecycle webhooks for a controlled set of MSISDNs.Offer a revenue share / pilot funding.

//    Approach 1–2 banks for pilot integration and agree minimal actions(block SMS OTP for flagged accounts, freeze outgoing transfers).

//Draft a consent & privacy policy for users; get legal review for your jurisdiction(e.g., POPIA).

//Build an MVP: ingestion, rule engine, partner webhook, user onboarding + audit logs.Run pilot for 3 months measuring prevented / failed fraud and false positives.

//    Iterate, then add insurance underwriting partner to cover losses and scale commercial rollout.

//Example user - facing messaging & templates

//Enrollment consent:
//“I authorize[Service] to receive security events from my mobile operator and to share alerts about unusual SIM activity with the financial institutions I nominate.I understand actions taken are temporary protective measures.” (store signature + timestamp)

//Bank alert(short):
//“[Service] Alert: SIM_SWAP riskScore = 85 for +2782XXXXXXX.Recommend: block SMS OTP & suspend transfers > ZAR5000.AlertID: alert_987.Signature: …”

//Final notes — why this can work

//The weakest link in many modern authentication flows is the mobile number; telcos are the source of truth for SIM lifecycle events.An orchestration layer that has consent + direct telco feeds + bank partnerships can close that gap and materially reduce SIM - swap losses.Insuring residual risk makes the product attractive to customers and partners.
